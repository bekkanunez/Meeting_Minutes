<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

It has been common than ever to work collaboratively across multiple functions so that knowledge and insights from different can be combined and evolved. 
However the way working professionals taking notes did not reflect the need to note more effectively and precisely. 
We are developers that aimed to solve this issue and the first version of our solution is Meeting_Minutes.
Meeting_Minutes allows multiple users work on the same notes, and users never find it hard to catch up on meetings or review meeting notes.
